# vrchat-immich-import
small script to upload VRChat photos into your Immich instance

## Setup
- Create an API key in your Immich account (click on profile top right > settings > api keys)
- Optional: Create an album for the script to put all VRChat photos into. Grab its UUID from your browser devtools or whatever
- Optional: Create a tag for the script to put all VRChat photos into. Grab its UUID.
- Optional (if you have VRCX screenshot metadata enabled): Create a tag for everybody you want recognized in photos. Add this in the script's user ID/tag mapping.
- Fill in script with your information/definitions/UUIDs.
- Place the script in your `(Pictures)/VRChat` folder and run! (The initial upload will take quite a while)

### if it breaks
you can message me but no guarantees i'll put a whole lot of effort into a 180 line script
